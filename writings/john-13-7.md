> "Jesus replied, 'You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.'"

Ever deployed to production at 3 AM and watched everything break? Yeah, me too. And in that moment, staring at error logs while your Slack blows up with "is the site down?" pings, this verse hits different.

## The Context (The Original Foot-Washing Incident)

Here's what's happening in John 13: Jesus is having dinner with his disciples. It's the night before everything goes sideways. He knows he's about to be arrested, beaten, and executed. He knows one of his closest friends is about to betray him. He knows another will deny even knowing him three times before sunrise.

And what does he do?

He grabs a towel, kneels down, and starts washing their feet.

In that culture, this was the job of the lowest servant. The person nobody wanted to be. Peter is scandalized. He literally tries to stop Jesus: "You'll never wash my feet!" He's thinking, "This isn't how it's supposed to work. You're the Messiah. I'm supposed to serve YOU."

That's when Jesus drops this line: "You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand."

Peter thinks he knows the architecture. He thinks he understands the system design. But he's looking at one microservice when God is orchestrating the entire distributed system.

## The Production Incident of Life

Look, we all want to understand the stack trace *right now*. When the build fails, when the PR gets rejected, when that "simple" refactor turns into a 3-day rabbit hole, we want answers immediately.

But here's the thing: we're basically trying to debug minified production code without source maps. God's got the full source. We're squinting at gibberish.

There are seasons where:
- Doors close (like that job you really wanted)
- Plans fall apart (your 5-year roadmap becomes a 5-day survival mode)
- Prayers seem to 404 ("Hello? Anyone there?")
- The build keeps failing and you can't figure out why
- That relationship ends
- The diagnosis comes
- The opportunity vanishes

In those moments, everything feels like chaos. It feels like the system is down. It feels like God is either not paying attention or His monitoring alerts are broken.

But this verse reminds me that what looks like chaos is often just... async processing. What feels like a total crash is sometimes just a necessary redirect. The system is working, even when we can't see the logs.

## Why Peter Couldn't See It

Peter couldn't understand because he was thinking too small. He was focused on the immediate social implications ("My teacher shouldn't be doing servant work") instead of the eternal significance ("The Son of God is demonstrating the kingdom of God").

Jesus was showing them what love looks like. What leadership looks like. What the entire mission was about. He was embodying the gospel before they even understood what the gospel was.

Sometimes we can't understand what God is doing because we're not ready to understand yet. The knowledge would break us. Or we're not in the right place to receive it. Or we simply don't have the perspective yet.

It's like trying to explain Kubernetes to someone who just learned what a variable is. They're not ready. The concepts are too big. They need to grow first.

## Trust > Understanding

We devs are obsessed with understanding everything *immediately*. Stack Overflow at 2 AM. Reading the source code of the universe. We want to grep through God's plan and find the exact line where things went wrong.

But faith isn't about having all the answers in your IDE. It's about trusting the One who wrote the original commit.

Jesus isn't saying "You'll never understand." He's saying "You don't understand NOW." There's a difference between "I can't know" and "I don't know yet." The second one has hope built in. The second one has a promise: "later you will understand."

## The Promise of 'Later'

"Later" is such a powerful word in this verse. It's not "maybe." It's not "possibly." It's a promise. Later, you will understand.

I've seen this play out in my own life:
- That job I didn't get? Led to a better opportunity I couldn't have imagined
- That painful season? Built character I needed for what came next
- That closed door? Protected me from something I couldn't see
- That delay? Perfect timing I couldn't have orchestrated

Looking back, I can connect the dots. I can see the pattern. I can understand why that had to happen the way it did. But in the moment? In the moment, it just felt like everything was on fire.

## What This Means for Today

If you're in a season where nothing makes sense, where the build is failing and you can't see why, where the logs are just noise, where you're staring at minified chaos, this verse is for you.

You don't have to understand everything right now. You don't have to have it all figured out. You don't need to see the full architecture diagram.

You just need to trust the Developer.

He's not debugging blindly. He's not guessing. He's not running `git blame` to figure out who messed up. He sees the full stack. He understands the dependencies. He knows exactly why that service had to restart.

Later, you will understand.

(And when you do, you'll look back and be like "ohhh, that's why that had to happen. Makes sense now.")

## The Foot-Washing Continues

Here's the beautiful thing: Jesus is still washing feet. He's still doing things we don't understand. He's still operating on a timeline and a logic that doesn't always match our sprint planning.

But he's also still making the same promise: "Later you will understand."

So when you're in the middle of the chaos, when the production incident of life is happening and you can't see the way out, remember Peter. Remember that even the guy who walked on water didn't get it at first. Remember that confusion isn't the opposite of faith. Sometimes confusion is just the prerequisite.

Trust the process. Trust the timeline. Trust the One who sees the full commit history.

Later, you will understand.
